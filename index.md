# Smart Mirror

<!--
Replace this text with a brief description (2-3 sentences) of your project. This description should draw the reader in and make them interested in what you've built. You can include what the biggest challenges, takeaways, and triumphs from completing the project were. As you complete your portfolio, remember your audience is less familiar than you are with all that your project entails!

You should comment out all portions of your portfolio that you have not completed yet, as well as any instructions:

# First Milestone

My main project is the Smart Mirror. Essentially, this project is similar to a iPad/tab that can be mounted on your wall and can be used as a mirror at the same time. This project would help the user view basic information like the time, weather, their calender events, and many other things catered to the personal interests of the user. For example, if the user is an investor, we could program the mirror to display stock prediction charts using stock predictive algorithms. The different components that were used in reaching the first milestone include the Raspberry Pi itself along with numerous cables that were connected to the Raspberry Pi which aided in the process of viewing what was happening (HDMI Cable) and control the Raspberry Pi (keyboard and mouse cables). Along with that, I also had to use numerous power cords to ensure that all devices that I was using had power. In terms of technical progress, I finished uploading the Magic Mirror OS onto my Raspberry Pi and finished modifying the module configurations. Module Configurations include modifying the alert system, the weather system, the calendar system etc. Some challenges that I faced while trying to attain my first milestone included modifying the alert system. While trying to modify the alert system in order to change the way that an alert is shown on the Magic Mirror, I ended up having a syntax error. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out which line of code had the syntax error because the GitBash only told me one error at a time, due to which the debugging process took longer. After spending about two hours, I decided to wipe the memory of the SD Card and restart everything, due to which I had a small delay in the overall building process. Apart from that, I had no other major issues in terms of trying to modify the module configurations and upload the Magic Mirror OS. Moving forward, I plan on 3D printing a custom frame to put my mirror into and personalize all the modules such as the calender etc. 

# Starter Project

I built a Retro Arcade Gaming Console to perfect my soldering skills. I used the starter kit and soldered the buttons, the speaker, and a battery case that is used to power the device. I chose to build this product because growing up, I loved playing various video anda arcade games, and I was really excited to build this, due to which I chose this project. The Retro Arcade Gaming Console works with a chip that takes in the input from all the buttons and uses this input to change the LED output on the LED screen that has been installed onto the Console. Along with that, there is a speaker that produces music everytime the player does something good during the game, wins the game, or loses the game. A main challenge that I faced while trying to build this project was desoldering two parts that I soldered earlier, but I had to desolder them since instead of soldering them individually, I soldered them together. Soldering was not something that I picked up easily, due to which I spent a lot of time on trying to fix my soldering issue. Apart from that, I had no major issues trying to build this console. Moving forward, I will be building a Smart Mirror using Raspberry Pi and hope to add numerous modifications to it and make it useful in more than one way.

For your first milestone, describe what your project is and how you plan to build it. You can include:
- An explanation about the different components of your project and how they will all integrate together
- Technical progress you've made so far
- Challenges you're facing and solving in your future milestones
- What your plan is to complete your project

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Bill of Materials
Here's where you'll list the parts in your project. To add more rows, just copy and paste the example rows below.
Don't forget to place the link of where to buy each component inside the quotation marks in the corresponding row after href =. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize this to your project needs.

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
